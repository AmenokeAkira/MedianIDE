# Median IDE
What is Median? Median is our own game development environment, classic applications, libraries, and extensions. We set out to bring together all aspects of programming, analysis, and coding in order to unite professionals from different fields.
Our idea is that programmers—beginners, juniors, experts, and project managers—will participate in creating our development environment, shaping it to meet their own needs and the needs of others whose knowledge may not be sufficient to tailor it to themselves. Open source, the ability to update the repository, and to showcase their progress are what will allow us to turn our vision into reality.
