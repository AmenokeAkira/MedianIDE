# Median Community
Median Community - a development environment that allows users to utilize any available extensions from GitHub. The environment is very flexible and is universal for complete optimization of projects and device operations. To work with the development environment, it is necessary to install the required extensions. The only downside of the Community version is the lack of compatibility between multiple extensions for working on a single project and direct access to system files.

# Median Professional 
Median Professional - a more professional and user-friendly development environment that allows the combination of multiple extensions within a single project. The only downside of the Professional version is that it requires a larger memory capacity to work with the development environment.
