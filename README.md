Median Community - a development environment that allows users to utilize any available extensions from GitHub. The environment is very flexible and is universal for complete optimization of projects and device operations. To work with the development environment, it is necessary to install the required extensions. The only downside of the Community version is the lack of compatibility between multiple extensions for working on a single project and direct access to system files.
